# PyNOTES
PyNOTES (NTU Optimization Technical Evaluation toolS) is an useful packages for various optimization technique tools(eg. simulator-based, equation-oriented).

Specifically, Simulated annealing (SA), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), and Bayesian Optimization (BO) are for single objective optimization. Fuzzy, and NSGA2, on the other hand, are for multi-objective optimization. 

Other files, such Economic.py, Get_variable.py, can cooperate with Aspen Plus to perform optimization.

## Required Package
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
or intall through 
```bash
pip install Pynotes
```
